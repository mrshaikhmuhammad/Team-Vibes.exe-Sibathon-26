Automating Hospital Appointment Scheduling with AI Assistance

Introduction
Currently, patients calling a hospital must wait as staff manually determine the right doctor based on symptoms, availability, and urgency. This process can take an hour, which is challenging for urgent cases. Our goal is to automate this process with AI while ensuring human oversight.
Current Process Challenges
·	Patients call and describe symptoms.
·	Hospital staff manually identify the right specialist (ENT, Ortho, etc.) using handbooks or experience.
·	They check doctors’ availability manually.
·	The patient is assigned an appointment.
·	This process may take up to an hour.
Proposed Solution
We will implement an AI-assisted appointment system. The patient calls or uses our website. The AI will analyze the symptoms and suggest the appropriate specialist. It will check doctors’ schedules in real time. A staff member will review the AI suggestion, confirm the diagnosis category (if needed), and finalize the appointment. The patient will receive immediate feedback.
Accuracy and Oversight
Accuracy is a priority. The AI suggests a doctor and time slot, but a trained staff member will verify the records and confirm the appointment before informing the patient. This ensures robust accuracy and human judgment in critical cases.
Key Benefits
Time reduction: Immediate AI doctor matching and scheduling.
Prioritization: Faster triage for urgent cases.
Efficiency: Reduced staff workload and decision time.
Accuracy: Human validation ensures quality.
